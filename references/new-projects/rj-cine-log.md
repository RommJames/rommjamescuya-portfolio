## 📖 About

**RJ Cine Log** is a clean, minimal watchlist app that lets you keep track of your cinema journey. Add movies and TV shows to your log, rate them on a 5-star scale, tag them with genres and watch statuses, and leave personal notes on anything you've finished watching.

All entries are managed in-app with full support for adding, editing, deleting, filtering, and sorting — no sign-up or backend required.
